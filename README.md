# HDF5_Parser
This python script parses a hdf5 NN model file to retrieve the weights and bias of the saved model layers. This was developed as a necessity during the OpenCL implementation of a multilayered perceptron model tuned and trained in python. 
The output is a series of .txt files each containing the corresponding weights or bias of a given layer.
